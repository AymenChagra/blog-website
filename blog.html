                This artical offers a basic understanding of the term "hardware"
                and defines the different components of computer hardware and their 
                role.

              Computer hardware refers to the tangible, physical 
              parts of a computer system. It encompasses a wide 
              range of physical components that work together to 
              enable the functioning of computers from processing, 
              storing, and interacting with digital information. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A simple way to categorize the computer components 
              is to divide them into internal parts which are 
              essential for the computer to function and external 
              parts which are primarily used for input, output, 
              and user interaction.

            <ul class="info-list">
              <li>
                <strong> The case:</strong> It's a plastic box that
                 provides a secure and organized housing for the various 
                 hardware components and keeps them protected from 
                 external elements, such as dust, moisture, and physical damage. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The power supply:</strong> It's the part that plugs into 
                the wall and provides all the other parts with the electricity needed 
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>mother board:</strong>  A wide flat board that all the components 
                plug-in to, it's the part that let all the other components send 
                electrical currents composing Data between each other. it's considered as 
                the most important component.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit or Processor): </strong> 
                It's the component responsible for executing instructions 
                and performing calculations necessary to run software applications. 
                While it's not capable of storing too much Data, 
                it's very good at doing things with Data: quickly reading it,
                 arranging it, doing the massive calculations needed to run your 
                 programs this is where most programs essentially run from, you can think of 
                 it as the brain of the computer everything that happens in your computer goes 
                 through your CPU at some point. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Hard drive (Disk Drive or storage): </strong> 
                it's where all of your data is stored, while hard drive can store 
                lots of data it's relatively bad at accessing that Data quickly, 
                because most of the hard drives are made of spinning disks it isn't 
                going to be able to constantly give your CPU the information it 
                needs to run certain programmes, but that where RAM comes in. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>RAM (Random Access Memory): </strong>
                RAM is another form of storage,
                it stores the exact same type of data as the Hard Drive, 
                but RAM sacrifices storage space for nearly instant accessibility, 
                unlike the Hard Drive that sends the Data through a tiny thin wire, the RAM 
                is arranged in long thin sticks that insert into your mother board.
                When you ran a program or a project file your CPU identifies which part 
                of Data are needed for that program to run,
                it pulls them from your Hard drive and it stores them in your 
                ram sticks for quick accessibility (this why when you start a 
                game it has to load, anytime you see loading 
                it's loading the Data that composes that level
                from your bulky Hard Drive into your RAM) 
                From user perspective follow this rule of thumb: RAM allows you
                to run intensive programs while Hard Drive allows you to have more 
                programs and storage.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Graphics Card (GPU or Graphic Processing Unit)</strong>  
                It's possible for 
                the mother board to display a three-dimensional world in to your monitor but
                it will not look good enough. That's 
                where coms the Graphic Card, it's like a standalone computer itself dedicated 
                for the sole task of figuring out what pixels need to light up on your screen, 
                in what color and in what time.If you are playing a game that has a very busy 
                and high texture world with lots of modules and different angles and colors, 
                your CPU is the thing that creates that world, it knows where the stuff is and 
                it does so with data that has been stored into your RAM which was loaded from 
                the Hard Drive, but it's your Graphic Card that figures out what it's supposed 
                to look like.

              Computer hardware is expected to become more sophisticated and 
              advanced in the next coming years. Technological advancements and 
              innovations continuously push the boundaries of what is possible in 
              terms of computer hardware capabilities. In the next few years, we 
              can expect advancements in a lot of areas such as Processing Power, 
              Memory and Storage, Graphics, Connectivity, energy-efficient designs 
              and power-saving technologies.
